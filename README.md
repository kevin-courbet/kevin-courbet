- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin Courbet.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Typescript, React (Next.js), Serverless, Golang, CSS (Tailwind), Python, Data Pipelines, Frontend Design, Data visualization, Big Data, Game Dev.
- ðŸŒ± I have 10+ years of experience building software as a full stack dev. In the corporate world, I have acted as Lead Dev, Tech Lead, and Engineering Manager in global companies. Pretty much been everywhere from backend to frontend: data science, web APIs, database design, expert systems (CLI, algorithmic libraries, ...), big data analytics, frontend... What I enjoy the most lately is full stack web development.
- Lately, my stack of choice has been Next.js, Typescript, TailwindCSS, Golang for backend for speed if needed, Python for data science and exploration etc.
- Even more recently, I'm getting into game dev as a hobby
