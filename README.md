- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin Courbet.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Typescript, React / Vue, Serverless, Lambdas, Golang, CSS (Tailwind), Python, data pipelines, frontend design
- ðŸŒ± I have 7+ years of experience building software as a full stack dev. In the corporate world, I have acted as Lead Dev, Tech Lead, and Engineering Manager in turn in global companies. Pretty much been everywhere: data science, web APIs, expert systems (CLI, algorithmic libraries, ...), big data, frontend... What I enjoy the most lately is full stack web development.
- Lately, my stack of choice is serverless, Vue 3 (Nuxt) or React (Next), Typescript, Tailwind, Golang for backend for speed if needed, Python for data science and exploration etc.
